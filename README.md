Project 1: HTML/CSS
Build a basic Google style webpage

For my first project I had to recreate the look of the Google search homepage. The actual functionality wasn't needed (ie the search box didn't need to work), but the overall look had to be the same. 

Creating the backbone of the html was easy enough, where I encounted dificulty was when creating the footer of the page with the bottom menu bar, getting the text to align to the left and the text to read from left to right, the text was reading from top to bottom.

After some reasarch on Google I found the answer on  W3School and applied it to the page (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_bottom_nav.asp).

Overall I feel through the page isn't a 100% perfect replica, it's look is close enough to the real thing.
